This will be a blog that reviews and rates burgers in NYC. There will be one Admin that has the ability to log in and make changes to the site. (Although the owner will have the ability to make this a collaborative effort and add more users). The Admin has the ability to post, edit, update,
and delete each blog post. The owner can access these features by logging in at the bottom of the
page. If the Admin is logged in, if they visit the index by restaurant page, they can add burgers here. When they visit a specific post’s page, they will see an Edit button that brings them to a form that allows them to edit, update and delete a burger.

The website will have a home page (where the user signs in), a list of all restaurants (index), a page will all burger images (index by image), and an about the author page. As a
visitor, when you click on the List of Restaurants you are brought to the a page that lists out all the restaurants that  have been rated in alphabetical order. If you click on a certain restaurant, you are brought to that specific burger post where you see the rating, picture(s) and review. When the visitor clicks on the All Posts page, they are redirected to a page that shows the burger images. This page will be organized with photos only. You may click on the
photo and be directed to that page’s  burger post. **So you can look up burgers by restaurant name or by looks.** The third link on the homepage will be to the About Bok page. This page will tell a little about the owner for this blog. If you are not signed in as the owner you will have access
to all the pages of the blog without the ability to make any changes.
