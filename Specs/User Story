This will be a blog that reviews and rates burgers in NYC. There will be one user that has the ability to log in and make changes to the site. (Although the owner will have the ability to make this a collaborative effort and add more users). The user has the ability to post, edit, update,and delete each blog post. The owner can access these features by logging in at the bottom of the page. (How do I put a create user without letting just anyone create a username?). If the owner is logged in, when they visit a specific post’s page, they will see an Edit button that brings them to a form that allows edits/updates.

The website will have a home page (where the user signs in), a list of all restaurants (index), a page will all burger posts (index by date), and an about the author page (if time permits). As a visitor, when you click on the List of Restaurants you are brought to the a page that lists out all the restaurants that  have been rated. If you click on a certain restaurant, you are brought to that specific burger post where you see the rating, picture(s) and review. When the visitor clicks on the All Posts page, they are redirected to a page that shows a list of all burger posts in date order -starting with the most recent. This page will be organized with photos only. You may click on the photo and be directed to that page’s  burger post. **So you can look up burgers by restaurant name or by looks.** The third link on the homepage will be to the About Bok page. This page will tell a little about the owner for this blog. If you are not signed in as the owner you will have access to all the pages of the blog without the ability to make any changes.

Sort based on type of meat??
