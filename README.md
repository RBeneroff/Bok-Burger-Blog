# Bok-Burger-List
Unit 2 Project - A NYC Burger Blog

Visit Bok Burger List: https://bokburgerlist.herokuapp.com/

Created a burger  blog for a friend who prides himself on his Instagram burger pictures. This is a simple blog that allows  the Admin to log in and post, edit, update and delete burgers. The visitor can view the posts by restaurant name or by burger picture (two index pages). If you enjoy Bok's Burger List, you can choose to sign up and receive an email every time a new burger is rated.

Things I'd like to add on:
- Finish the Amazon S3 database for images so URL's are not necessary
- Implement the email blasts
- Create a map for each burger's location so that it changes from page to page with the appropriate burger (handlebars?)
- Have a restaurant model so you can create more than one burger for a restaurant
- pull pictures from Instagram & be able to star certain burgers
- checklist of where he's been, where he wants to go

Technologies used: Javascript, CSS, HTML and handlebars, Passport, Mongo, Mongoose

Unresolved Problems:
- textarea vs input: textarea doesn't show previous input when editing/updating while input doesn't enable you to fill the box with text (rather it continues on one line)
- Mystery white bar at bottom of homepage above footer (goes away when footer is not sticky but then footer floats in center of page)
- Amazon S3 database use for images
